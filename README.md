In my real estate sales analysis project focused on the United States, I introduced a novel approach by implementing a growth/declination
indicator using Power BI. This distinctive feature utilized a dynamic display of green and red indicators, allowing for swift identification of areas
exhibiting sales growth or decline. Additionally, the project incorporated advanced techniques, such as decomposition trees, shape maps and DAX,
to extract in-depth insights into the real estate market.# real-estate-analysis
